# Accounts

You will primarily have two types of accounts:

1. **Lab-managed accounts**: Managed by the IT team at your research lab.
2. **University-managed accounts**: Managed by Sorbonne University.

## D'Alembert lab accounts

### Webmail account
Login of the form `jane.doe@dalembert.upmc.fr`. Allows you to connect to the [lab webmail](https://webmail.dalembert.upmc.fr).

!!! note
    You will also receive an email alias in the format `jane.doe@sorbonne-universite.fr`. This isn't a separate email account - it's simply an alias (forwarder) to your lab email. Any messages sent to this address will be automatically forwarded to your primary lab email address.

    If you do not receive this alias automatically, contact Simona.

### Intranet account
Login of the form `jdoe`. Useful to access some intern ressources of the lab (office booking).

## Sorbonne University accounts

You should automatically be assigned an account ID and password upon signing your contract with the university. Check that it works on the [Annuaire UPMC webpage](https://www.annuaire.upmc.fr/).

Each time you want to access a Sorbonne University service, you will need to use this account.
