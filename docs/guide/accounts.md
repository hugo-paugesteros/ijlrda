# Accounts

You will primarily have two types of accounts:

1. **Lab-managed accounts**: Managed by the IT team at your research lab.
2. **University-managed accounts**: Managed by Sorbonne University.

## D'Alembert lab accounts

### Webmail account
Login of the form `jane.doe@dalembert.upmc.fr`. Allows you to connect to the [lab webmail](https://webmail.dalembert.upmc.fr). Ask the IT team to get one.

!!! note
    You will also receive an email alias in the format `jane.doe@sorbonne-universite.fr`. This isn't a separate email account - it's simply an alias (forwarder) to your lab email. Any messages sent to this address will be automatically forwarded to your primary lab email address.

    If you do not receive this alias automatically, contact Simona.

### Intranet account
Login of the form `jdoe`. Useful to access some intern ressources of the lab (office booking).

## Sorbonne University accounts

You should automatically be assigned an account ID and password upon signing your contract with the university. Check that it works on the [Annuaire UPMC webpage](https://www.annuaire.upmc.fr/).

Each time you want to access a Sorbonne University service, you will need to use this account.

!!! note
    If, like most PhD students at the lab, Sorbonne University is both your employer and your university, you will get two accounts :
    1. A student account, the login being your student ID
    2. An employee account, the login being a username

    Most of the time, the second one is all you need. Every service is accessible via an employee account. The reciprocal is not true
