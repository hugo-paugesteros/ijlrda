# Contributing

This guide provides all the necessary information to help you get started with contributing to our documentation, which is composed of Markdown documents in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hugo-paugesteros/ijlrda) and is automatically built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) whenever a pull request is merged.

## Getting started
First, you'll need to set up your environment for making contributions:

1. **Fork the repository**: Go to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hugo-paugesteros/ijlrda) and fork it to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine to make changes.
3. **Install MkDocs** (Optional): If you wish to preview your changes locally, you'll need to install MkDocs. Follow the installation guide on their website.

## Making contributions
### Adding/Editing content :
1. **Create a new branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch in your forked repository.
2. **Add/Edit Markdown Files**: Make your changes or add new content in the appropriate Markdown (.md) files, located in the `docs/` directory.

### Previewing Your Changes
If you've installed MkDocs locally, you can preview your changes by running the following command in your project directory:
```bash
mkdocs serve
```
This will start a local web server. Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see your changes.

### Submitting Your Contributions
Once you are satisfied with your changes:

1. **Commit your changes**: Add your changes to your fork and commit them with a clear commit message.
2. **Push to your fork**: Push your changes to your GitHub fork.
3. **Create a pull request**: Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/hugo-paugesteros/ijlrda) and create a new pull request. Target the main branch for your pull request and provide a clear description of your changes.

Your pull request will be reviewed and merged :)
